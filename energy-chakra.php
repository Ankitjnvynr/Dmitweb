                    “ Chakra healing involves the idea that imbalances or blockages in these energy centers can lead to
                    physical, emotional, or spiritual issues. Various practices aim to restore balance and promote
                    well-being, including meditation, visualization, yoga, and energy healing techniques. Practitioners
                    may use different colors, sounds, and affirmations associated with each chakra to facilitate
                    healing.
                    <br>
                    It's important to note that while chakra healing has roots in spiritual and esoteric traditions, it
                    is not universally accepted within the scientific or medical communities. People who engage in
                    chakra healing often do so as a complementary practice alongside conventional medical care.
