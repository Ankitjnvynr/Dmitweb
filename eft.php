              <h3>
                EFT – Emotional Freedom Technique:
              </h3>

              <p class="mt-6">

                Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), also known as tapping or psychological acupressure, is a therapeutic
                technique that combines elements of traditional Chinese medicine with modern psychology. It is based on
                the idea that imbalances in the body's energy system contribute to emotional and physical issues, and by
                tapping on specific meridian points on the body, these imbalances can be corrected.

              </p>
              <p class="mt-6">
                The process involves the individual focusing on a specific issue or problem while tapping on designated
                acupressure points with their fingertips. The points are typically located on the face, hands, and upper
                body. While tapping, the individual also repeats affirmations or statements related to the issue they
                are addressing. The combination of tapping, focused attention, and positive affirmations is believed to
                help release energy blockages and promote emotional healing.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-6">
                EFT is often used to address a variety of emotional and psychological issues, including stress, anxiety,
                phobias, traumatic memories, and more. It is considered a form of energy psychology and is sometimes
                used as a complementary or alternative therapy alongside traditional mental health approaches.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-6">
                While some people find EFT to be effective in managing their emotional well-being, it's important to
                note that scientific research on the technique is still evolving, and not all claims about its
                effectiveness have been conclusively supported. Individuals interested in trying EFT should consult with
                qualified practitioners or mental health professionals. </p>
